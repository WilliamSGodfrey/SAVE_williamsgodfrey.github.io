I'm William S. Godfrey.

Most people just call me Will.

I am a structural analyst currently living and working in the great city of Chicago with my wife, dog, and two cats. I ride my bike, obsess over craft beer, look at maps, and putz around with python & R.

If you would like to do the social media thing, look me up on any of the social platforms listed below.

### This site

This website currently uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a very slightly modified version of the [So Simple Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) and is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

##### Why Jekyll?

The site used to be on Wordpress which was annoying with its constant nagging about updates and awful WYSIWYG editor on the backend. I felt like I had to very carefully work around the awfully generated HTML in order to accomplish the simplest things. And it wasn’t like I needed all that functionality anyway. This site is used very little. It was time to simplify.

Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator." In other words, the website is now simply a set of static files. Posts are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and, since I'm using Github Pages for hosting, pushed to the site.
