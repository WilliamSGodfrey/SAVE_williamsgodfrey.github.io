### Me

I am a licensed structural engineer based in the Atlnta area. I have over 14 years of experience in the analysis and design or new structures as well as the initial response, condition assessment, and forensic evaluation of structures damaged by natural disasters, collapses, fires, building envelope failures, and other large and complex losses.

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with with my wife, son, and dog. I also like to ['jog', ride my bike,](https://www.strava.com/athletes/374453) look at maps, and prentend that I can create useful things with Python & R.
