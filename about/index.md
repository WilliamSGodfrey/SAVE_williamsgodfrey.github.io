### Me

Hi, I'm William S. Godfrey but most people just call me Will.

I am a licensed structural engineer based in Chicago. I have over 10 years of experience in the analysis, design, and investigation of new and existing structures. My educational and professional background has focused on stress analysis using analytical mechanics (static and dynamic) and its practical application as it pertains to the built environment. Some notable projects that I have been part of include:  

 * [Indiana State Fair Commission, August 13, 2011, Collapse Incident Investigation and Report](http://www.thorntontomasetti.com/projects/indiana_state_fair_commission_collapse_incident/)
 * Structural design development of the nuclear island safety related structures for the NRG South Texas Project Units 3 & 4
 * [Site-specific seismic analysis of safety related nuclear structures for DTE Enrico Fermi Unit 3](http://www.sargentlundy.com/projects/enrico-fermi-u3-project/)
 * Physical Plant Security structural design development and detailed design for the [Barakah Nuclear Power Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barakah_nuclear_power_plant)
 * [Chico Highschool Lincoln Center](https://coactdesignworks.com/project/5/chico-high-school-lincoln-center/2/Education/0/Filter) - I stepped into this project shortly after the schematic design phase was completed. My role consisted of nearly 100% of the design development and detailed design which included the design of all steel, concrete, and masonry associated with the project. I also performed 100% of the BIM modeling using Revit Structure which I then used to produce the structural design deliverables (construction documents, specifications, etc.). I was fortunate to work with a very inspiring and very trusting boss.

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with with my wife and dog. I also like to 'jog', ride my bike, look at maps, and prentend like I can create useful toops with python & R.

If you would like to do the social media thing, look me up on any of the social platforms listed below.

### This site

This website currently uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a very slightly modified version of the [So Simple Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) and is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

##### Why Jekyll?

The site used to be on Wordpress which was annoying with its constant nagging about updates and awful WYSIWYG editor on the backend. I felt like I had to very carefully work around the awfully generated HTML in order to accomplish the simplest things. And it wasn’t like I needed all that functionality anyway. This site is used very little. It was time to simplify.

Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator." In other words, the website is now simply a set of static files. Posts are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and, since I'm using Github Pages for hosting, pushed to the site.
