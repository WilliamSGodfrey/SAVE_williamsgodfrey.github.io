I'm William S. Godfrey.

Most people just call me Will.

I am a structural analyst currently living and working in the great city of Chicago with my wife, dog, and two cats. I ride my bike, obsess over craft beer, look at maps, and putz around with python &amp; R.

If you would like to do the social media thing, look me up on any of the social platforms listed below.
