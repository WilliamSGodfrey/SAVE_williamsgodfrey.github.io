  * **Brewery:**&nbsp;[Spiteful Brewing](http://spitefulbrewing.com/)
  * **Beer:**&nbsp;I&nbsp;Hate My Boss Coffee Stout
  * **Batch:** #53
  * **Beer type:**&nbsp;American Stout
  * **ABV:** 6.5%
  * **Imbibition date:** 10-17-13
  * **Temperature:** Room temperature bottle in refrigerator for 60 minutes
  * **Serving type:** Poured from 22oz bottle into a Guinness style pint glass
  * **Price:** $8.99/22 oz (Binny&#8217;s Beverage Depot)

Spiteful Brewing is another relatively young Chicago brewery, originally founded in January 2010. I think they brew out of a basement somewhere with a 2.5BBL brewery, very small. I grabbed this beer when I ran out to specifically grab the two last [Orange Truffle Abductions](http://www.williamsgodfrey.com/orange-truffle-abduction-review/) that a friend alerted me to last week. The label on this beer is awesome, the description/rant on the label (below) is even better. This beer was brewed in collaboration with Halfwit Coffee Roasters, I love collaboration beers.

#### Appearance:

**Score:** 3.5/5&nbsp;(good ++)
  
I&nbsp;Hate My Boss Coffee Stout&nbsp;pours a very dark brown into the glass with about half a finger&#8217;s worth of a head the color of overly creamed coffee. It seems very thick coming out of the bottle, I actually wrote &#8220;motor oil&#8221; down in my notes when I was drinking it. The head probably sticks around for 1 or 2 minutes, not too long but long enough to be there when you take the first sip. After receding to the edges of the glass, the bubbles kind of have a tendency to cling to the glass with each sip, sliding back down to the now lower, level of beer.

#### Aroma:

**Score:** 4.0/5 (outstanding)
  
Lots of roasty and toasted smells coming from the beer at first. A healthy dose of dark roast coffee scents coming up as well. There&#8217;s this faint odor that I couldn&#8217;t place, something on the backside of the big roasty, coffee smell. It was definitely something familiar but I was really struggling to put my finger on it until I realized it was exactly what Jane&#8217;s Hazelnut flavored coffee smells like. I was ecstatic when I recognized this smell as it was entirely unexpected. I mean, it&#8217;s always great to stumble onto something like that, I feel like I expect and find the same flavors with every beer. As the beer warms I also start finding some carmel-ish tones in there. No indication of hop anywhere.

#### Taste:

**Score:** 3.5/5 (good++)
  
The taste was good but entirely expected. Toasted grain, some roasted bitterness up front followed by malty sweetness, some burnt coffee, and maybe finishing with some caramel pepper. Again, no indication of hop anywhere. Good and fairly complex, but not WOW.

#### Mouthfeel:

**Score:** 3.25/5 (good +)
  
Much thinner than expected. After the motor oil thoughts I had as I poured, I expected a big, thick mouth coating. Not so. The beer is rather thin and a tad more carbonated than I was expecting. It was smooth though, thin and smooth, not too unlike a cup of coffee that has been made through a [<div id="attachment_353" style="width: 262px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The label is great and, as I alluded to above, the reason I bought the beer in the first place. The side of the label, pictured to the right, is hilarious. And very relatable for those of us that might be working in cubical farms.

#### Overall:

**Score:** 3.75/5 (outstanding -)
  
I Hate My Boss Coffee Stout by Spiteful Brewing is a solid beer. I&#8217;ll admit that I tend toward the larger stouts and maybe I went into this one with misplaced expectations. I can see this beer being combined with a good couple of scoops of vanilla ice cream and making one heck of a good coffee beer float. Something that I might actually try in the near future.

#### Conclusion:

**Final Rating<sup>[1]</sup>:** 3.63/5
  
**aFR<sup>[2]</sup>:** 

Good but not exceptional. With so much great and personally undiscovered beer out there right now I&#8217;m not certain I would pick this up again, unless I decide to make one of those coffee beer floats.

Notes:

  1. My final rating is a weighted average of the 5 component ratings. See the [Beer Review Methodology Page](http://www.williamsgodfrey.com/beer-review-methodology/ "Beer Review Methodology").
  2. The **aFR**&nbsp;(adjusted Final Rating) is my attempt at standardizing beer ratings across the increasingly vast pricing and container volume differences. It&nbsp;ranges from near 0 to near 25, the higher the number is the better the beer is in terms of quality and value.
