### Basic Beer Info:

  * **Beer:** Peach Grand Cru
  * **Batch:** n/a
  * **Beer type:** Belgian Strong Dark Ale
  * **ABV:** 12%
  * **Date of tasting:** 4-25-2014

This bottle was a gift from my wife for my 31st birthday early last month. I have been gravitating towards Belgians lately and this bottle was a nice surprise. I am fairly unfamiliar with Great Divide Brewing Co. as they aren&#8217;t very well distributed here in Chicago, with the exception of their Yeti stout (both regular and aged varieties.)

### Appearance: 4/5

It&#8217;s a beautiful orange/copper color with a fine white head as it pours from the bottle. As the beer settles into the glass, the head recedes to a thin pale ring at the edge, providing a nice lacing on the side of the glass with each sip I take.


### Aroma: 3.75/5

Where&#8217;s the peach at? Seriously though, I was expecting to get hit with a nice nosefull of summer peach, especially after reading Great Divide&#8217;s [description of the beer](http://greatdivide.com/2013/08/22/peach-grand-cru/). Not a bad aroma though, I get a really sweet, nutty scent. Some nutty biscuits maybe. Perhaps a hint of vanilla, and if I wish it hard enough, _maybe_ a whiff of stone fruit, maybe.


### Taste: 3.75/5

Yeasty, bready, caramel, a little tang, and then the alcohol heat, just barely, on the back end. It&#8217;s a solid Belgian ale, but again, _where are the peaches?_


### Mouthfeel: 4/5

Thin and effervescent. Refreshing.


### Label:

I like it. Simple and well designed.


### Overall: 3.76/5

This was a tough one to nail down an Overall score to. Ultimately, it is a solid Belgian ale, few complaints on that front. I find it lacking in peach though, not much in terms of aroma, taste, or essence. So I dinged it a quarter point, or so, for that. I would be interested to taste this beer side by side with another non-fruited Belgian Strong Dark Ale.


Weighted Final Rating[^1]: 3.58/5

[^2]: The **aFR** (adjusted Final Rating) is my attempt at standardizing beer ratings across the increasingly vast pricing and container volume differences. It ranges from near 0 to near 25, the higher the number is the better the beer is in terms of quality and value.
