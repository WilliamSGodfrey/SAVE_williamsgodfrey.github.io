  * **Serving type:** Poured from 22oz bottle into two tulip glasses
  * **Price:** $8.99/22 oz bottle (Binny&#8217;s Beverage Depot)

So this beer was an impulse buy. We were at Binny&#8217;s a month ago or so, just perusing the beer section like everyone else, and I saw this. It stood out to me for some reason, maybe it was the low price (relative to other 22 oz. bombers filled with an imperial stout) or maybe it was the pretty good label design. Either way, here I am, I bought it and I drank it and now I am going to write about it.

### Appearance: 4.25/5

I&#8217;m not so sure what it is about this beer but it looks pretty handsome sitting in the tulip glass. It&#8217;s dark, nearly completely opaque. In fact, when I hold the glass up to the light here, I can&#8217;t see any light at all coming through the beer. When I tip the glass to take a sip though, the little bit of transparency reveals itself around the edges of the liquid and it appears a crystal brown color, almost like the color of the bottle it came in. There is a decent amount of head, about a finger&#8217;s worth or so. As the head receded it formed a chunky ring around the edges of the glass with a little island of fine bubbles in the middle, slowly spinning as I move the glass to my mouth.

My tasting assistant thinks it looks like a shot of espresso when you look down at the top of the glass. I concur. The slight lacing and island-ing of the head combined with the deep, dark, brown/black does really make it look like a (giant) shot of espresso.

### Aroma: 3.5/5

So much milkshake. How am I supposed to think of anything but an alcoholic milkshake as I take my first sip? The smell of chocolate and &#8230; marshmallows (?) is incredibly strong. It&#8217;s almost over powering, it is overpowering. Maybe that marshmellow smell is really the odor of vanilla. Can something smell like chocolate and vanilla at the same time?

No indication of the malt, roasty, and hoppy aromas typical of an imperial stout.

### Taste: 3.25/5

What&#8217;s in my mouth? This is weird, the taste is hard to describe without using the term &#8220;CHOCOLATE!!&#8221; Maybe I&#8217;m being unfair and letting the aroma taint my taste description.

Ok, so I admit that I get some roasty malt flavors, maybe some burnt malt. Something bitter, is that the chocolate? Even a bit of hop bitterness on the back end, right before the subtly, gradual, tummy wearing alcohol heat.

### Mouthfeel: 4/5

Eh, it fits. Smooth on the way down with a bit of a carbonation tickle. The aspect of the beer that is most true to form?

### Label:

I like it. Well designed, not obnoxiously stupid, fits within their branding.

### Overall: 3.5/5

Gosh, I feel bad giving a beer an overall rating of 3.5. I feel like I&#8217;m a softy. The beer is good, but it isn&#8217;t great. The chocolate flavor is a little bit overdone. I prefer my adjuncts to _compliment_ the beer instead of define the beer.

That said, would I buy this beer again? Not in the bottle like this time, but if the mood struck me just right, and it was just after dinner, and it was on tap? Then, yeah, why not? This would be absolutely fantastic over some vanilla ice cream. And now I need to go to the grocery store.

[^1]: My final rating is a weighted average of the 5 component ratings. See the [Beer Review Methodology Page](http://www.williamsgodfrey.com/beer-review-methodology/ "Beer Review Methodology").
[^2]: The **aFR** (adjusted Final Rating) is my attempt at standardizing beer ratings across the increasingly vast pricing and container volume differences. It ranges from near 0 to near 25, the higher the number is the better the beer is in terms of quality and value.
