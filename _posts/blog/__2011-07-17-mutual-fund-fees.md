I sat down this morning to take a look at JOG&#8217;s IRA account, she recently rolled some money over from an old employer&#8217;s 401K plan. It was time to figure out how to integrate this &#8220;new&#8221; money into our existing portfolio without exposing us to too many mutual fund fees.

Most of our retirement savings sit in target date mutual funds. Target date funds are a relatively new type of mutual fund classification designed to provide a simple investment solution through a portfolio with an asset mix that becomes more conservative as the target date (usually retirement) approaches. See [Wikipedia&#8217;s article on target date funds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_date_fund) for more info.
  
I knew which fund I wanted to place the money into but found myself with a bit of a&nbsp;dilemma. Our IRA accounts are through Fidelity, but the fund I wanted to purchase is managed by Vanguard; Fidelity charges a $75 [transaction fee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund_fees_and_expenses#Transaction_fees) when purchasing anything outside of their &#8220;family&#8221; of funds. This would turn out to be only one of several mutual fund fees I would need to evaluate.

My problem was this: the Vanguard fund I wanted to purchase would include a $75 transaction fee but had an overall lower [expense ratio](http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/expense+ratio) than the equivalent Fidelity target date fund (which would have no transaction fee but a higher expense ratio). Was paying the $75 transaction fee to get the Vanguard fund worthwhile when considering the expense ratio of the Fidelity fund? Luckily this is nothing that a little spreadsheet work can&#8217;t answer for us.

In this particular case it turned out that, over an expected 27 year holding time and given the difference in expense ratios (0.19% to 0.80%) it was a far better idea to pay the $75 transaction fee now. Assuming an annualized return of 6.00% (the historical return of the S&P500, excluding dividends, is 7.2%), we&#8217;ll save over $1,900 by using the Vanguard fund. It is AMAZING how much of a difference expense ratios make. Keep an eye on those things, folks, as well as the rest of the mutual fund fees out there.

The spreadsheet I made to solve this problem can handle several types of mutual fund fees typical of today&#8217;s funds. I&#8217;ve placed a public version of the spreadsheet up on Google Documents: [Mutual Fund Fees Effect](http://goo.gl/FOiaG).
