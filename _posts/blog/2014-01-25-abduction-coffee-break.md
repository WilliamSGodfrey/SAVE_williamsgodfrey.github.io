Found this little guy hiding on the bottom shelf in the back of the fridge. It&#8217;s probably been in there since the [I Hate My Boss review](http://www.williamsgodfrey.com/hate-my-boss-coffee-stout-spiteful-brewing/), for some reason I remember buying two coffee beers that day&#8230;

As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, Pipeworks Brewing Co. is a relatively new brewery here in Chicago (est. Jan. 2012). I would say that they are known for being a little crazy and experimental but it seems to be working well for them. Lot&#8217;s of buzz around the beer nerd circles about their Abduction stout line (this is part of that) and some of their hoppier beers. They sure do sell at a premium price&#8230; But enough of that, let&#8217;s drink.

### Appearance: 4/5

It looks like a stout. It&#8217;s dark, it&#8217;s nearly opaque, and it has very little head. It does have the &#8220;ruby glisten&#8221; at the edges, betraying a slight transparency when I sip. I think the head was a khaki color, it went away too fast for me to note the color.

### Aroma: 3.75/5

I&#8217;m a little disappointed. Maybe I&#8217;ve been drinking beers that are too good lately (2012 & [2013 BCBS](http://www.williamsgodfrey.com/bourbon-county-brand-stout-2013/) anyone?) but this smelled, well, plain. It smelled like _my_ imperial stouts smell and I&#8217;m not getting $10.99 a bottle for mine (low blow). I&#8217;m getting a lot of roasted malt smell, maybe a tiny bit of biscuit. It seems very one dimensional. (I have been drinking too well lately.)

[I let it warm up a bit more and the nose is filling in a bit. There is a coffee sweetness in there, maaybe a bit like coffee flavored [Mu‘assel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%E2%80%98assel "aka shisha").]

### Taste: 3.5/5

I&#8217;m just not that impressed here. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it isn&#8217;t bad but it isn&#8217;t killing it either. There&#8217;s a medium malty sweetness on the front end followed by a lot of roasted malt. The coffee is very timid, maybe not even present. I can&#8217;t say I would have know it had coffee in it if I hadn&#8217;t read the label. On the fence about whether that&#8217;s a bad thing necessarily. (For the record, since I compared the beer&#8217;s aroma to my own beer, this one tastes better than anything I could brew.)

### Mouthfeel: 4/5

Perhaps this is where the beer excels. It feel right on the tongue, silky without being milky, just the right carbonation.

### Label:

Mr Beejay Oslon (not a spelling mistake) does it with this one. It&#8217;s silly, it&#8217;s fun.

### Overall: 3.5/5

Eh sums it up. Some of the Abduction variations have been awesome, like the [Orange Truffle Abduction](http://www.williamsgodfrey.com/orange-truffle-abduction-review/ "Orange Truffle Abduction, Pipeworks Brewing") I&#8217;ve had or the Rasberry Truffle Abduction I keep hearing about. It is bad, and I&#8217;d drink it again if given the chance, but it just isn&#8217;t that great either. I&#8217;m disappointed that the aFR is so low for this beer. I can say that it isn&#8217;t even close to being the lowest rated beer I&#8217;ve reviewed, but the relatively high price brings the aFR down. Tears.

Weighted Final Rating[^1]: 3.58/5

[^1]: My final rating is a weighted average of the 5 component ratings. See the [Beer Review Methodology Page](http://www.williamsgodfrey.com/beer-review-methodology/ "Beer Review Methodology").
[^2]: The **aFR** (adjusted Final Rating) is my attempt at standardizing beer ratings across the increasingly vast pricing and container volume differences. It ranges from near 0 to near 25, the higher the number is the better the beer is in terms of quality and value.
