<p style="text-align: left;">
  Jane and I joined a farming co-op (obviously, it&#8217;s Nevada City, CA) this year, it&#8217;s being called The Sun Ridge Family Farm. So far it&#8217;s been great, we can&#8217;t wait to start getting something besides greens! Between the two of us, we&#8217;ve been putting in, roughly, at least 8 hours of work each week. It&#8217;s enjoyable work, really. So nice and peaceful out here, especially in the morning.

  Below are some pictures of the farm on a typical July morning when Jane and I were there for our work shift.
