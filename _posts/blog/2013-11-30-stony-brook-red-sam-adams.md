Happened across this on the shelf in the local grocery store while traveling for work and bought it at the same time that I bought the [Kvasir](http://www.williamsgodfrey.com/kvasir-dogfish-head/)&nbsp;by Dogfish Head. I had no idea that Sam Adams still did anything on this small a scale, let alone barrel aged.

#### Appearance:

**Score:** 4.0/5 (outstanding +)

The beer is a dark reddish-brown with a fair amount (3/4&#8243;) of light tan head that disappears quickly before becoming a ring of fine bubbles around the edge of the glass.

#### Aroma:

**Score:** 3.0/5 (good)

Big malty aroma here; lot&#8217;s of sweet malt and a bit of oak. That&#8217;s about it.

#### Taste:

**Score:** 3.25/5 (good +)

Big sour upfront, maybe a touch of vinegar, followed by a hint of spice. Not much oak in there, a bit of alcohol heat on the back end.

#### Mouthfeel:

**Score:** 3.0/5 (outstanding)

Seems a bit thin to me. Low on the carbonation.

#### Label:

The bottle seems a little overdone to me. [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). They didn&#8217;t KISS. There is just so much going on, the bottle is some weird shape, there&#8217;s a cork & cage, there is a little booklet/label hanging from the bottle neck, and the bottle itself is some sort of opaque glass/ceramic material. Wat?

#### Overall:

**Score:** 3.0/5 (good)

This beer is 25.4 oddly shaped ounces of &#8220;Meh&#8221; for me. Wasn&#8217;t awful, wasn&#8217;t great. At least it doesn&#8217;t come in at an astronomically high price.

#### Conclusion:

**Final Rating<sup>[1]</sup>:** 3.16/5

**aFR<sup>[2]</sup>:** 

Stony Brook Red from Sam Adams, there it is.

Notes:

  1. My final rating is a weighted average of the 5 component ratings. See the [Beer Review Methodology Page](http://www.williamsgodfrey.com/beer-review-methodology/ "Beer Review Methodology").
  2. The **aFR**&nbsp;(adjusted Final Rating) is my attempt at standardizing beer ratings across the increasingly vast pricing and container volume differences. It&nbsp;ranges from near 0 to near 35, the higher the number is the better the beer is in terms of quality and value. See the [Beer Review Methodology Page](http://www.williamsgodfrey.com/beer-review-methodology/ "Beer Review Methodology").
