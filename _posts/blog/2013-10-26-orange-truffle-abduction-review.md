Pipeworks Brewing Co. is a relatively new brewery here in Chicago (est. Jan. 2012) that I have been really excited about trying out. I have heard nothing but good things about their <a href="http://pdubs.net/abd" target="_blank">Abduction</a> imperial stout from a few friends and even better things about the limited run fruit variations. Normally, unless it is some sort of sour ale, I am not the biggest fruit beer fan. It seems to be difficult for a lot of brewers to incorporate the fruit flavor into the beer without losing it entirely during the fermentation process or ending up with way, way too much of it still left in the final product. But enough of that, on to the review.

#### Appearance:

**Score:** 3.75/5&nbsp;(outstanding -)
  
Orange Truffle Abduction pours a very dark brown into the glass with about a quarter finger&#8217;s worth of a dark tan head that doesn&#8217;t stick around for very long. After a minute or so the head recedes to a thin hoop of bubbles around the edges of the glass. The beer sits very plain.

#### Aroma:

**Score:** 4.25/5 (outstanding +)
  
The smell is interesting, I was expecting a giant nose full of roasty, dark goodness but instead was greeted with this rather complex, citrusy-chocolate smell. There is this almost musty layer to the odor, but musty in a good way. Musty like the way wine barrel houses smell musty, except instead of barrels of wine, maybe these barrels are filled with orange juice. I don&#8217;t want to overstate the orange smell however, it is quite faint, there but not **THERE**. As the beer continues to warm up the smell reminds me a lot of the way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%E2%80%98assel" target="_blank">shisha </a>can smell as it&#8217;s being packed into a hooka bowl; earthy, fruity, sweet, subtle.

#### Taste:

**Score:** 4.0/5 (outstanding)
  
The taste, at first, is a lot of roasty malt, as to be expected. The roast then transitions to a faintly chocolate-orange flavor (which totally had me thinking of those <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry's_Chocolate_Orange" target="_blank">Terry&#8217;s Chocolate Orange</a> candy things that always seemed to find their way into my parents&#8217; house around the holidays), a sweet and earthy chocolate. Finally there is a tad of malty sweetness that gives way to a boozy heat as you swallow.

#### Mouthfeel:

**Score:** 3.75/5 (outstanding -)
  
The mouth on this beer is very good, quite smooth or velvety with a certain amount of thickness. The beer coats the tongue and mouth without making me feel like I needed to go brush my teeth. The booze heat, again, is also a clear component and rounds out the taste.

#### Label:

Fun label, interesting, but with so many awesome beer labels out there right now, I was a little disappointed. (Seriously, what kind of person gets disappointed over beer labels? THIS KIND.)

#### Overall:

**Score:** 4.0/5 (outstanding)
  
I am impressed with the beer and consider it very good. My notes show that I initially jotted down an overall 4.5/5, I guess you need to leave plenty of room at the top.

#### Conclusion:

**Final Rating<sup>[1]</sup>:** 4.01/5
  
**aFR<sup>[2]</sup>:** 

Orange Truffle Abduction from Pipeworks Brewing Co. is a great beer albeit a bit on the expensive side. I think it&#8217;s a very good example of the direction Chicago beer seems to be headed and suggests that the young Pipeworks Brewing Company is headed in the right direction. I would buy and enjoy it again.

Notes:

  1. My final rating is a weighted average of the 5 component ratings. See the [Beer Review Methodology Page](http://www.williamsgodfrey.com/beer-review-methodology/ "Beer Review Methodology").
  2. The **aFR**&nbsp;(adjusted Final Rating) is my attempt at standardizing beer ratings across the increasingly vast pricing and container volume differences. It&nbsp;ranges from near 0 to near 25, the higher the number is the better the beer is in terms of quality and value.
