_Updated January 5, 2020_

As I prepared to retake the lateral portion of the Structural Engineering licensing exam in April 2016, I found myself curious about the historical pass rates for the exam. After doing some digging online, I found there wasn't a single source that provided that information and decided to collect and share my own findings.

All information provided here was obtained directly from NCEES unless otherwise noted. This table is updated twice a year.

If you have data you'd like to share with me so that I can include it here, please get in touch via email.
