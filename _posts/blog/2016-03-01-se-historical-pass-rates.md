_Updated December 21, 2018_

As I prepared to retake the lateral portion of the Structural Engineering licensing exam in April 2016, I found myself curious about the historical pass rates for the exam. After some digging online, I found there wasn't a single source that provided that information and decided to share my findings here.

All information below was obtained from the NCEES website following the release of scores unless otherwise noted. This table is updated twice a year.

If you have data you'd like to share with me so that I can include it here, please get in touch via email.
