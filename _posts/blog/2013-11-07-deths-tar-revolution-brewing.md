Revolution Brewing is a fairly new Chicago brewery. They first opened their doors in 2010 with a small brewery and eventual pub in the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago. They&#8217;ve really come into form lately, releasing some absolutely fantastic beers. I keep buying their beer with the intention of reviewing it, but I keep drinking it too fast; never stopping and taking the time to actually write down and record the experience. This time, I finally did it. I got my hands on 4 bottles of their recently released Deth&#8217;s Tar, a barrel aged imperial stout. This beer is a single-run-never-coming-back-again beer, I was really anxious that they were going to run out before I made it over to grab a few bottles. It is everything I had hoped for, plus a high five.

#### Appearance:

**Score:** 4.5/5 (outstanding ++)
  
Sexy. Deth&#8217;s Tar pours the same color as the dark brown glass bottle it comes from. A deep brown the color of wet soil with about 1 1/2 fingers of fairly light tan head. As the head recedes after a handful of sips the bubbles become very sparse, almost disappearing completely. The beer itself is entirely opaque.

#### Aroma:

**Score:** 4.75/5 (perfect -)
  
Oak, so much oak. The nose is initially a very oaky, slightly spicy, nearly identical to a good whiskey. There is _not_ a big booze smell or hotness to the odor at all. No hop aroma but a definite sweetness from the malt. As it warms I get grains. A bit of toast or cracker, maybe bread.

My reviewer&#8217;s assistant was very adamant that she got a nose full of whiskey and cherry coke, or maybe rum and coke. I concur, if my eyes were closed and I caught a whiff of this I would assume it was a slightly sweet mixed drink with some whiskey in it.

#### Taste:

**Score:** 4.5/5 (outstanding ++)
  
Bliss. My notes say,

> &#8220;oak, malt, dark malt, chocolate, caramel, OAK, love, booze on back, heat after booze, favorite?&#8221;

I really think that this beer has the potential to cellar very well. That booze flavor and heat should (could?) mellow a bit, bringing the chocolate and caramel flavors a chance to mingle a bit more with that oaky malt. I currently have 2 bottle stashed away. Perhaps we&#8217;ll see another review in a year&#8217;s time.

#### Mouthfeel:

**Score:** 4.25/5 (perfect -)
  
Great body, smooth with a slight tickle from small, very fine bubbles that you don&#8217;t even realize are there until you feel them. The consistency, maybe the coating, really reminded me of milk, or of an oatmeal stout. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to learn that there was some oatmeal in the grain bill.

#### Label:

Revolution has such a great aesthetic from a design standpoint. Their entire branding is sharp, focused, and coherent, this label is no different. It&#8217;s frame-able.

#### Overall:

**Score:** 4.75/5 (outstanding +)
  
It&#8217;s amazing. I struggled with whether to give this a higher overall rating. This is probably my current favorite beer and I think it&#8217;ll be there for a while.

#### Conclusion:

**Final Rating<sup>[1]</sup>:** 4.58/5
  
**aFR<sup>[2]</sup>:** 

Deth&#8217;s Tar from Revolution Brewing is an all around excellent beer that has the potential to get even better with a year or two of cellaring.

Notes:

  1. My final rating is a weighted average of the 5 component ratings. See the [Beer Review Methodology Page](http://www.williamsgodfrey.com/beer-review-methodology/ "Beer Review Methodology").
  2. The **aFR** (adjusted Final Rating) is my attempt at standardizing beer ratings across the increasingly vast pricing and container volume differences. It ranges from near 0 to near 25, the higher the number is the better the beer is in terms of quality and value.
