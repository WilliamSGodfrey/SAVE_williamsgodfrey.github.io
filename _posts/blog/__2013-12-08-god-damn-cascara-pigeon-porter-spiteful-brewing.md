Another one from Spiteful Brewing here in Chicago. I learned a few fun facts about these guys recently. First, they are self distributed, meaning that they deliver their beer to all the liquor stores in the area. This surprised me because I see their stuff all around (maybe I've only ever seen it at Binny's) and as a consumer, I figured they were distributed just the same as all the other &#8220;big&#8221; Chicago micro-breweries. And then, second, they've only been around for a year or so and are getting some [national attention](http://americancraftbeer.com/item/my-favorite-chicagoland-craft-beers-from-2013.html?category_id=5&fb_source=message "FAVORITE CHICAGOLAND CRAFT BEERS FROM 2013") for the quality of some of their beers. And finally, they're located less than 2 miles from our front door. That makes three different, very good, young breweries within a 30 minute walk from our place ([Half Acre](http://halfacrebeer.com/ "Half Acre Brewing") and [Metropolitan Brewing](http://metrobrewing.com/) being the others). What a great time to be a beer fan and live in Chicago.

A big thanks to RC on this one for leaving this behind in our fridge after house sitting for us in November!

### Appearance: 4.0/5

Lots a head on my pour. 1 1/2 to 2 fingers worth of a solid, light tan head of fairly large bubbles. The beer itself is a very dark brown with glints of muddy maroon highlights around the edges, especially when taking a sip. It's largely opaque, but it's hard to tell if that's from sentiment or just due to the super dark color of the beer. My guess is the later.

### Aroma: 3.0/5

Roasty, maybe a bit burnt smelling. Not much malt character in support and no hop aroma at all. I found the aroma a little underwhelming.

### Taste: 3.5/5

I largely found this to taste like a standard porter. Lots of roasty grain in front, a bit of malty sweetness, and some burnt notes at the end. No outright hop flavor here. Perhaps a bit of bitterness of the back end from the tea (?), or perhaps it was just from the roasty, toasty, burnt, grain flavors on the front end.

### Mouthfeel: 4.0/5

A good mouthfeel, true to form. A noticeable fine, carbonated tickle on the tongue. No sign of alcohol warmth.

### Label:

Spiteful always has some good fun with their labels. I'm glad to see someone shares my feelings about the Chicago pigeons.

### Overall: 3.5/5

I always like the idea of weird adjuncts (in this case, cascara tea, apparently) but they don't always pan out. I had to really look for any sign of the tea here, I think that defeats the purpose of adding it. Obviously adjuncts shouldn't overwhelm the beer, but I do believe that they should contribute to the overall character of the beer in some way. With that said, I think the tea was a whiff on this one. Perhaps I should taste it side by side with the regular God Damn Pigeon Porter.

### Conclusion:

Final Rating[^1]: .48/5

[^2]: The **aFR** (adjusted Final Rating) is my attempt at standardizing beer ratings across the increasingly vast pricing and container volume differences. It ranges from near 0 to near 25, the higher the number is the better the beer is in terms of quality and value.
